# Home-Automation-using-Hand-Gestures

Here I have used OpenCV library to detect hands.
Libraries that should be installed for this application is 
  mediapy
  CVZone
  Serial
  time
I used all these libraires to detect hands and gestures.  I have written code to 
process the gesture data. for the code check the Serial_comm_py.py file. 
I have use Serial Communication to implement control over home appliances.
I have connected Arduino to python, Python will take control of Arduino's serial monitor.
